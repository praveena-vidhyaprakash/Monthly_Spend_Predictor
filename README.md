- 🧠 Uses a **Linear Regression** ML model
- 🌐 Interactive web interface built with **Flask**
- ✅ Pre-trained model included for instant use



 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer      | Tools Used                      |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| ML Model   | scikit-learn, pandas, numpy      |
| Backend    | Python, Flask                    |
| Frontend   | HTML, CSS                        |
| Dataset    | Custom CSV (`Spend_Data.csv`)    |



 📦 Requirements

Before running the app, ensure you have:

- Python 3.6 or higher  
- pip (Python package installer)



📥 Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/praveena-vidhyaprakash/Monthly_Spend_Predictor.git
cd Monthly_Spend_Predictor

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. (Optional) Retrain the model
python train_model.py
A pre-trained model (spend_model.pkl) is included.

▶️ Running the App
To start the Flask server:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Then open your browser and go to:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://localhost:5000
🎉 Fill out the form and get your predicted monthly spend!

🧠 How It Works
User inputs age, income, education level, and occupation.

Data is processed and passed to the trained Linear Regression model.

The model returns a monthly spend prediction.

The result is displayed in a styled, user-friendly box.
